I tried creating a modern website for a lamp product, focusing on a minimal design that doesn’t overwhelm users. The goal was to build a clean and intuitive UI with smooth routing across multiple pages. While I could have added more complex features, I intentionally kept things simple to prioritize usability—since too much complexity can distract from the product itself. I took time to explore the layout and flow, drawing inspiration from the Apple iPhone website, and experimented with components to bring a similar elegant feel to this project.
